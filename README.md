# Ant-game
This is a mini web-based game. The game itself is played on a canvas.  At the bottom of the canvas are two picnic tables.  
Ants randomly start crawling from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen.  Clicking on an ant (either with the mouse or the finger) crushes it. 
If an ant manages to get to 500 pixels (i.e., the bottom of the screen), the game ends and a “Game Over” sign appears.  
The game tracks how many ants got killed.
